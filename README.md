## UPDATE

This repository only has code for HW1.  It turned out that the "style"
of the programming assignments for this course was not a great fit for
this kind of project.  For each assignment the amount of code to be
written by the student (eg, usually a two or three line gradient
computation) was _much_ smaller than the amount of setup code
provided.  I will still leave the HW1 code up in case that is useful
for anyone.

## README

This repository contains Python ports of the Octave starter code for
the programming assignments in the
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.com/) online class
[Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/class/index)
taught by
[Professor Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/).  

This code requires the [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), and
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) libraries.

This should go without saying, but _use at your own
risk_. Contributors are not responsible for lost assignment points due
to bugs, etc.

Forks and pull requests welcome and encouraged!
